--1. DATABASE AND TABLE(s) CREATION:
-- Create the “Messy” database manually (by using SSMS menus)
-- Using the script provided, create the “Messy” database table within the newly created
-- “Messy” database

-- Done.   Database and table created without problems



--
--
--2. AFTER DONE WITH THE TABLE CREATION, OBSERVE THE DATABASE STRUCTURE AND DATA
--AND COMMENT ON THE FOLLOWING:
--
--2.1. The “Messy” table for errors, inconsistencies in its structure, any/every kind, data duplication,
--missing/omitted data, etc. For example, you may notice that a number of relations contain
--more that one value, which violates relational database design principles.
--
----Assigned to: Oluremi, Michael, Parvathy, Pablo
----Everyone create several's SQL for each problem

--
--3. ANALYSIS OF THE DATABASE BY COMPOSING SQL STATEMENTS:
--
-- 3.1 Compose (write) and run appropriate SQL statements to analyze the “Messy” table for any
--inconsistencies you have identified in the requirement 2. For example, you may want to find
--out the number of actual customers in the Messy table, that contains over 24,000 records.
--Are there 24,000 customers or actually less than that. You may also try to analyze and
--document on how and why you think this happened that the number of customers is
--substantially less than the overall number of records within the Messy table.

--4. TASKS REQUIRING ONLINE RESEARCH:
--
-- 4.1. Conduct online research in order to create the necessary SQL queries that will assist you with
--the analysis. For example, you may want to analyze the amount of missing/omitted data
--within the Messy table. In order to do this, you might need to “count” some of the missing
--data. Your creativity is highly encouraged.
-- 4.2 Please document the online sources you have used as commented out text within your SQL
--script to be submitted.

-- 5. BASED ON THE RESEARCH CONDUCTED, COMPOSE THE BUSINESS RULES, WHICH YOU THINK
-- WERE LIKELY USED BY THE OLD BUSINESS, WHILE DESIGNING AND STORING DATA IN ITS
-- Messy TABLE.
